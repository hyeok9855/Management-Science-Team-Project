## Selecting Optimal Sites for New Hydrogen Vehicle Charging Station in Seoul

This repository is about the final project on management science (SNU 251.207A 001).  
We tried to select the optimal sites for new hydrogen vehicle charging station in Seoul, by building this as a combinatorial optimization problem and solving it with random brute-force algorithm.  

The experiment process is described in **Analysis.ipynb**, you can reproduce the results.  
The report of this work is in the **final report** folder.  
Note: If the Open API Keys was expired, you need to issue another one and replace with it.
